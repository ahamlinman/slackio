/*

Package slackio implements real-time communication with Slack behind io.Reader
and io.Writer interfaces.

To get started with slackio, construct a Client instance using a Slack API key.
Then, create Reader and Writer instances as necessary using this Client. See
the Reader and Writer examples for more details.
